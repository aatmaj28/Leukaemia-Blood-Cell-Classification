# Leukaemia Blood Cell Classification with Ensemble Deep Learning üî¨

## üß¨ Project Overview

An innovative deep learning approach to revolutionize the classification of leukaemia blood cells. This project leverages the power of ensemble learning techniques to automate and enhance the accuracy of leukaemia subtype classification, a critical step in determining personalized treatment strategies for patients.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop an automated classification system for leukaemia blood cells
- Overcome the limitations of traditional manual classification methods
- Improve the accuracy and objectivity of leukaemia subtype identification
- Create a scalable solution for large-scale and real-time applications

## üß† Technical Implementation

### Ensemble Architecture

Our approach combines three powerful neural network architectures:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - Hierarchical extraction of essential features from blood cell images
2. **SqueezeNet** - Compact neural architecture optimized for efficient model inference and deployment
3. **Inception V3** - Advanced feature extraction through multi-branch architecture for complex pattern recognition

### Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive normalization and preparation of blood cell images
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization of class distributions and sample images
- **Model Training**: Individual training of CNNs, SqueezeNet, and Inception V3 architectures
- **Ensemble Creation**: Strategic integration of individual model predictions through weighted averaging
- **Performance Visualization**: Detailed comparison of model accuracies and learning curves

## üìä Key Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| CNN | 79.4% |
| SqueezeNet | 82.6% |
| Inception V3 | 84.1% |
| **Ensemble** | **86.1%** |

The ensemble approach significantly outperformed individual models, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining diverse neural network architectures for this classification task.

## üöÄ Future Directions

- Integration of multi-omics data for more comprehensive analysis
- Enhanced model interpretability to aid clinical decision-making
- Clinical validation and implementation in real-world healthcare settings
- Development of more targeted data augmentation strategies for blood cell images
